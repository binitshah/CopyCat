CopyCat
=======

CopyCat is an American Sign Language (ASL) game for deaf children. The goal is to help young deaf children develop language skills. CopyCat allows these children to practice their ASL through a fun game.

## Plot

Iris has to save her friends from a Bad Santa who has stolen them. On her way, she'll encounter enemies and will have to use her magical ASL abilities to get past them.

## How it Works

This 2D Unity game is only a part of the story. There is another verifier model that runs along with this game to verify from the Kinect V2 data whether the signed phrase matches the correct phrase.
